# Final_Project
Final Project for Data Science Course at Purwadhika School

In this project, I try to make Text Classification Prediction whether an item is recommended or not based on written reviews. I also use NLP analysis to explore data and find some insights. The model presented in the project is not yet perfect and still need further development to give better result.
